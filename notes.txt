OOP 

    Class definition (blueprint or template)
    static member of class eg: defaultNumberOfFaces

    Creating instances of Class

    eg: var die = new Die();

    ^^this will be die.Faces

    OO OO you could right click the square to minus bets, and left click to plus bets
    if square has bets on it, it could change color

    Homework = work the Mat and Bet objects

    can you put a for loop inside an arrow function - what are an arrow function's limitations?

    Object: Constructor, Properties, Methods

    Common JS - write JavaScript modules. Source  -> export App -> import (require)

    There is an ES6 way to do this, but it's not widely supported, esp not by Node. So you need Babbel

    Dev of Crown and anchors from an OOP perspective

    validation is to make sure you get the expected data types



    a new game will have a new mat, an array of bets, an array of die, and a state

    new.
    place bet.

    when there's no game, reate new
    when there's new ame, plce bet
    when bets, roll dice
    show result
    tally
    reset

    objects exist in a state

    place bet Methods

    play

    reset


    class homework - create a bet Methods
    
    which will: 

    validate game state

    validate bet values

    if bet value > 0, pass new value to that face.
